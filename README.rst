This library wraps the Neo Trinkey to make using the neopixels and pads very easy,
as well as including a class (optional!) that makes using the Neo Trinkey as a
status display a doddle.

Dependencies
=============

This library depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Just install the latest version of CircuitPython onto your board, and then
include the neotrinkey folder in the `lib` folder on board.

Usage Example
=============

.. todo:: Add a quick, simple example. It and other examples should live in the
examples folder and be included in docs/examples.rst.

Documentation
=============
API documentation for this library can be found on `Read the Docs <https://robjwells-circuitpython-neotrinkey.readthedocs.io/>`_.
